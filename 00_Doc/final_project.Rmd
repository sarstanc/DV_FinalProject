Link to repo:

###Link to datasets online
Utility rates by zipcode:
<https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/u-s-electric-utility-companies-and-rates-look-up-by-zipcode-feb-2011-57a7c>

Unemployment rates by zipcode:
<http://blog.splitwise.com/2014/01/06/free-us-population-density-and-unemployment-rate-by-zip-code/>

Population by zipcode:
<http://blog.splitwise.com/2013/09/18/the-2010-us-census-population-by-zip-code-totally-free/>

We truncated the data to zipcodes in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana (zipcodes between 70000-80000) to limit the focus and decrease the size of the file.


###Load csv files into Oracle
![alt text](../02_Images/import_data_oracle.png)
![alt text](../02_Images/oracle_import1.png)  
Select the csv file to import  
![alt text](../02_Images/oracle_import2.png)  
Check that left and right enclosures do not conflict with data  
![alt text](../02_Images/oracle_import3.png)  
Name the table  
![alt text](../02_Images/oracle_import4.png)  
Choose all columns that go into the Oracle table  
![alt text](../02_Images/oracle_import5.png)  
Change column names to remove spaces and starting numbers  


###Load data into Tableau
![alt text](../02_Images/import_data_tableau.png)
![alt text](../02_Images/all_data_imported.png)  
Load each data set one at a time to blend rather than join  


###Data blending in Tableau
![alt text](../02_Images/edit_relationships.png)  
Edit relationships between data sets to link common columns  
![alt text](../02_Images/data_blending1.png)  
Existing relationships will appear here. Select "custom" to change.  
![alt text](../02_Images/data_blending2.png)  
Use Population by zipcode as the primary dataset and Unemployment and Utilities as the secondary datasets.  
![alt text](../02_Images/linked_data1.png)  
![alt text](../02_Images/linked_data2.png)  
Orange indicates the secondary data sources  

###Creating a calculated field
![alt text](../02_Images/calculated_field.png)  
Resrate, Indrate, and Comrate are all dimensions from the Utility Rates data source. Since these dimensions contain string values, they must individually be converted to integers in order to calculate an average.  


###Creating visualizations in Tableau
![alt text](../02_Images/vis_unemploy+comp.png)  
Crosstabs with utility company name and unemployment rate by zip code
![alt text](../02_Images/vis_resrate+pop.png) 
Generate longitude and latitude to show residential utility rates compared to population by zip code
![alt text](../02_Images/filter_resrate+pop.png)  
Filter out null residential utility costs
![alt text](../02_Images/vis_rate+pop.png)  
Bar graph shows average utility cost broken down into residential, commercial, and industrial costs per zip code
![alt text](../02_Images/filter_rate+pop.png)  
Filter out null and 0 value utility costs


###Creating visualizations in R
```{r, warning=FALSE}
source("../04_R/unemployment_rank.R")
```
3 part join  

```{r, warning=FALSE}
source("../04_R/avgrate.R")
```
Multiplied by -1 to workaround for calculated field
